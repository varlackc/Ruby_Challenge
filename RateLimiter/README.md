# Algorithmic Challenge: Rate Limiter

Project configuration:

The project contains the `RateLimiter.rb` file containing the implementation of the program.
There is a `Gemfile` that has the requirements for the installation of `rspec` version `3.13.1`.
There is a test file `RateLimiter_spec.rb` that will be used to test the program using `rspec`.

To install the dependencies you will have to run the `bundle install` command.

Running the Tests:
In order to run the test you will need `ruby` version `3.4.4` and `rspec` version `3.13.1` installed in your system.
You also will have to run the following commands to execute the tests using `rspec`

`bundle exec rspec RateLimiter_spec.rb`

we could also execute the tests by running the following command:

`rspec RateLimiter_spec.rb`
